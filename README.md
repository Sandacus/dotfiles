# dotfiles

Dotfilfes! 

These are my dotfiles tracked using a bare git repository.

I followed this great setup tutorial: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles 

NB: I used the alias _"dot"_ instead of config, so _dot add_ not _git add_ etc.

For my Ubuntu set up. At the moment I'm going to add Mac OSX dotfiles in a seperate repo but hope to merge to them to a single repo at some point.
